# 0x1D C - Binary trees :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concepts of binary trees! This was a project done with the contribution of my peer in many other SWE projects  [Jorge Zafra](https://github.com/jorgezafra94/) Kudos!

At the end of this project, We were able to undesrtand these questions:
  
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
